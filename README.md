# Optimizing-Deep-Neural-Networks-Initialization-Regularization-and-Gradient-Checking
Implements core deep learning optimizations: weight initialization (Zeros, Random, He), regularization (L2, Dropout), and gradient checking. Enhances convergence, prevents overfitting, and ensures reliable backpropagation validation.
